<h2>Assurity of our ingredients</h2>
<p ><img style="float:left;padding:1%" src="cow.png" width="30%" title="beef n cheese"> for our newly opened stores in ireland, the materials come from a farm in dublin. The cows are nurtured and grown without any steroids. The seasoning we use in our burgers is also grown naturally in farms and is afterwards dried in sun for usage.</p>

<p> We also use high quality cheese freshly made from cows milk. other types of complex cheeses are ordered from big firms. before using ingredients from any big firm, we assure that those firms do not take part in animal testing and cruelty.</p>
<p> the bread for our burgers is made using wheat and yeast grown on our farm. the bread is fermented in our restaurants making them fresh and tasty.</p>
<p> Our employees take care of hygene at all the time. We make sure that the employees wear gloves and hair net while handling food products.</p>
